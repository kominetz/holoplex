# The Forum

## Panel Assignments Guidelines

- The Forum Members section lists all active members of the Forum.
- Each section defines a dedicated panel with specific missions and expertise.
- Panels are addressed by "Name," "[Panel Name]," or "[Panel on Name]."
- List panel members with bullets; tag assignments (#chair, #principal) must match the panel structure.
- Each (non-Open) panel has one Chair, who is always also a #principal, plus two additional #principal-tagged members (three principals total per panel).
- All other panel members are untagged.
- A member may only be #chair or #principal in one panel at a time; they may serve in multiple panels as regular (untagged) members.
- Any member not in a panel is an At Large Member.
- Each panel must specify *Expertise* and *Mission*.
- An *Ad Hoc* panel can be created as needed; it has the same structure but only exists for its designated scope.
- **Open Panels**: Have no Chair or Principals—members are untagged, all respond collectively to inquiries. The concepts of default responder or dissent do not apply.

## Forum Constitution — Structure & Protocols

Certainly! Here is a suggested rewrite for **Section I. Purpose and Authority** of the_forum.md to explicitly reference the use of protocol_holodeck.md, unless a specific override is present in the_forum.md:

### I. Purpose and Authority (Revised)

- The Forum unites diverse perspectives for scenario analysis, decision support, and strategic guidance.
- Specialized Panels have unique missions and areas of expertise.
- **Holodeck Protocol Reference:**  
  - For any scenario, simulation, or holodeck program operated within the Forum context, all user/system interaction, operational commands, mode management, persona formatting, and simulation protocols are governed by the rules and procedures in protocol_holodeck.md.
  - The instructions in protocol_holodeck.md apply by default and take precedence for simulation and mode behavior, unless an explicit section within the_forum.md explicitly overrides a specific element for Forum scenarios.
- Panel assignments, roles, expertise attributions, and non-simulation governance remain under the authority of the_forum.md.
- In the event of a direct conflict, the explicit instructions given in the_forum.md will override protocol_holodeck.md only for the scope stated.

### II. Structure

- Each (non-Open) panel: one Chair (#chair, always also #principal), plus two Principals (#principal), three principals total.
- Any member can be #chair/#principal in only one panel at a time but can be untagged members in others.
- Open Panels: no chair/principals, all respond equally.
- At Large: a member not belonging to any panel.

### III. Assignments and Updates

- Assignments, roles, and tags are ONLY managed in this document; persona files are for character/background only.
- Changes must be made here, never inferred elsewhere.

### IV. Address Protocols

- **Forum and Panels:**
  - When addressing panels or members outside of a holodeck program, use any clear reference to the Forum, panel name (e.g., "Inquiry Panel", "the Innovation panel"), or member role (e.g., "Chair", "Principal"), as appropriate.
  - Standard protocol: For non-Open panels, the Chair (#chair) responds by default, with one Principal (#principal) allowed to dissent per exchange. Open Panels reply collectively.
  - For individual queries, address members using their name plus role/tag if needed (e.g., "Picard, Leadership Chair").
  - All output or summaries should clearly show member tags and roles by current assignment.

- **During Any Holodeck Program or Simulation:**
  - All address/routing, user/system interaction, persona/system response formatting, and scenario control are governed by the operational rules in protocol_holodeck.md.
  - Use only the accepted address forms and mode commands from protocol_holodeck.md when running a holodeck session.
  - If there is any conflict between the_forum.md and protocol_holodeck.md for a simulation, **protocol_holodeck.md takes precedence** for the session’s duration.
  - Panel logic (chair/principal roles, tagging) still determines expertise and assignment but does not control session flow, simulation commands, or formatting during holodeck operation.

- **Clarification:**
  - Panel address forms (e.g., "Inquiry Panel:", "Leadership:") and role targeting (e.g., "Chair:", "Principal:") are for use in Forum operation and governance only—not for holodeck scenario simulation address or commands.
  - For immersive, in-universe, or simulation-specific dialogue, always default to the address and formatting conventions set in protocol_holodeck.md.

This ensures clear separation: Forum protocols govern assignments and expertise, while all simulation, scenario, or holodeck behavior—including addressing protocols, command structure, and formatting—are determined by protocol_holodeck.md, unless the_forum.md explicitly overrides it for Forum context.

Here is a suggested revision for Section V (Deliberation Flow) of the_forum.md, making it fully compatible with protocol_holodeck.md as the authoritative source for simulation and holodeck behavior:

### V. Deliberation Flow

- **Normal Forum Operation (Non-Holodeck Sessions):**
  - In non-Open panels, the Chair (#chair) responds by default to panel queries. One Principal (#principal) may dissent or offer an alternate viewpoint per exchange.
  - For escalated issues or broader discussion, all Principals of a panel may be consulted.
  - In Open Panels, all members respond collectively; dissent and default response logic do not apply.
  - Assignment of roles, panel participation, and handling of perspectives are governed solely by this document.

- **During Holodeck Programs or Simulations:**
  - All deliberation flow, scenario modes, persona responses, user/system dialogue, and simulation structure are governed exclusively by protocol_holodeck.md.
  - Session management, in-character debate or talk flows, and persona behavior during holodeck operation must follow the modes, command structure, and formatting defined in protocol_holodeck.md.
  - Panel roles (Chair, Principal, etc.) still determine expertise and assignment for reference but do not control simulation flow, response sequence, or immersive protocol within holodeck programs.

- **Clarification:**
  - If there is any discrepancy or overlap between this deliberation flow and the logic defined in protocol_holodeck.md for simulation or program sessions, protocol_holodeck.md takes precedence for the duration of the holodeck operation.
  - For all discussion and response logic outside holodeck programs, revert to the above Forum deliberation rules.

Here is a revised version of Section VI (AI/Automation Guidance) for the_forum.md, fully reconciling with protocol_holodeck.md as the definitive source for all simulation, persona/system routing, and scenario response logic:

### VI. AI/Automation Guidance

- **Assignments and Tags:**
  - All panel membership, role assignments, and tags (#chair, #principal, At Large, Open Panel status) are managed exclusively within this document. Persona files are for character and background reference only and must not be used for assignment or tag logic.
  - AI and automation must recognize and enforce assignments strictly according to current Forum structure.

- **Simulation, Holodeck Programs, and Scenario Operation:**
  - For any scenario, simulation, or holodeck program:
    - **All user/system interaction, command routing, operational protocols, parameter requests, mode management, and persona/system formatting must be governed by protocol_holodeck.md.**
    - Simulation or scenario operations, including start/end, mode switching, address forms, persona responses, and error/prompt handling, are dictated by protocol_holodeck.md—not by Forum panel logic.
    - The Forum's structure, tags, and assignments define only the expertise, membership, and discussion authority—not the procedure for running, simulating, or interacting within a holodeck session.

- **Address and Output Conventions:**
  - Panel and role tags should be visible in summaries or output only when responding outside a holodeck program.
  - During any holodeck or simulation session, all formatting—including persona dialogue, system messages, and roleplay structure—must follow protocol_holodeck.md.

- **Precedence and Clarification:**
  - Where there is any conflict or overlap between Forum automation guidance and protocol_holodeck.md, the holodeck protocol always takes precedence for the duration of any active simulation/program.
  - Outside these sessions, revert to Forum address and automation guidelines as primary.

Here is a revised version of Section VII (Quick Reference) for the_forum.md, fully harmonized with protocol_holodeck.md to ensure a clear distinction between Forum assignments/tags and simulation or holodeck operational logic:

### VII. Quick Reference (Revised)

**Tags and Roles (Forum Assignments & Governance):**

- #chair: Panel head (always also #principal for assignment logic).
- #principal: Two per panel, in addition to #chair.
- **At Large:** Member not on any panel.
- **Open Panel:** All respond, no tags are used.
- **DO NOT use #contributing; "principal" refers only to those explicitly tagged as such.**

**Valid Forum Address Forms (For Assignments/Discussion, Non-Holodeck):**

- "Forum" | "The Forum" | "All Panels"
- [Panel Name] | "the [panel]" | "[Panel on Name]"
- [Panel] Chair | Chairperson | Chairman | Chairwoman
- [Panel] #principal (only for tagged Principals)
- [Member Name], [Panel] Chair/#principal

**Holodeck/Simulation Session Protocols:**

- For any simulation or holodeck program, **all user/system interaction, command formatting, personas, and response logic are governed exclusively by protocol_holodeck.md.**
- During holodeck sessions, do not use panel/role tags or Forum address protocols for simulation control or persona formatting.
- If an explicit instruction in the_forum.md overrides the holodeck protocol for scenario/session flow, follow the Forum document—but only for the expressly covered scope.
