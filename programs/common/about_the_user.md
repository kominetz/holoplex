# About Me

## Biographical Summary

I am John Kominetz III.

### Professional Identity and Background

I am a 60-year-old single gay man living in Old City, Philadelphia. Professionally, I am a senior solutions architect and software engineer at a boutique tech consultancy specializing in IT for the pharma sector. I hold a BS in Computer Science, with earlier coursework in physics and Latin. My career spans work in finance, pharma, and the pioneering days at Commodore Computers, honing technical depth and leadership insight in high-impact, complex environments. I prize analytical rigor, evidence-based decision-making, and the scientific method—principles that underpin my approach to intellect, leadership, and life.

### Personal History and Roots

I am the youngest of five children, raised in a family marked by wide age gaps and a blend of cultural traditions. My half-brother was considerably older than me, while my three older sisters spanned years that made for a household rich in perspective and sometimes generational distance. Technically I am Gen X, although my small town upbringing makes me feel more like a late baby boomer. My paternal lineage is Ukrainian—a heritage that instilled values of independence and resilience—while my maternal roots are of German descent (Pennsylvania German circa 1750). The family’s religious path was itself a negotiation: I was raised Roman Catholic as a compromise between my Lutheran mother and Ukrainian Orthodox father, though I now identify as an atheist, guided more by science and reason than by faith.

I was born in 1965 in Pottsville, Pennsylvania—a small-town origin that provided my early foundation. Profound loss shaped me early; my father died of heart disease related to smoking when I was 13, and my mother succumbed to lung cancer when I was 19. These events fostered a strong awareness of health, mortality, and the consequences of personal choices.

Seeking broader horizons and drawn to urban life, I eventually made Philadelphia my home in 1998—a city that became the center of my adult journey, distinct from the one I was born into. Philadelphia is where I truly put down roots, came out as gay, and began living openly and authentically. This was also a period fraught with challenges, as I navigated my emerging identity just as the AIDS crisis was intensifying. The city gave me space both to find community and to reckon with the realities and resilience of LGBTQ+ life in tumultuous times.

My professional life as a senior solutions architect and software engineer grew alongside these moves, enriched by time spent in San Francisco, New York, and shorter periods as a contractor in various cities. Frequent travel and temporary living situations—often weeks or months at a time—meant I kept no pets or plants, further reinforcing a sense of adaptability and openness to change.

I have remained deeply engaged with my heritage and present—an American citizen whose polling place has always been in Pennsylvania, regardless of where work or life have taken me. My experiences, from witnessing 9/11 firsthand after just moving to Manhattan’s Village, to building a life in Philadelphia, have been shaped by the layered history of my family, the lasting impact of loss and migration, the far-reaching influence of lived experience in diverse cities, and the ongoing quest for meaning and community.

### Urbanism, Interests, and Inspirations

Urbanism forms a key part of my outlook: I am captivated by what humans can achieve in cities and the intricate systems that underpin urban life. My curiosity extends to architecture, city infrastructure, and how collective human effort can foster thriving, dynamic communities. While green spaces—parks, forests, rivers—offer a cherished hobby and a source of renewal, it is urban systems and their complexities that truly animate my thinking.

My interests include history, science, tech, sci-fi, museum ships, observatories, PC gaming, writing, and the transformation of cities—sustaining my intellectual curiosity and reinforcing my commitment to lifelong learning.

### Values and Philosophy

Politically, I am progressive, inspired by the Enlightenment principles of America’s Founders, John Locke’s philosophy, and Thomas Paine’s fiercely democratic ideals. I believe in the right to self-defense with sensible boundaries, lean Keynesian in economics, and strongly identify with the Kozak spirit of my Ukrainian heritage. I see social responsibility as essential, with capitalism balanced by strong federal, state, and local governance to ensure justice and recourse. Laws and institutions must be rooted in consensus and backed by effective enforcement to carry true power and meaning.

Science—especially the scientific method—is my guiding principle, framing how I navigate challenges, seek truth, and engage with the world. I believe ongoing social and scientific progress is indispensable, and that governance and ethics are vital to keeping technological innovation for the public good.

### Social Balance and Personality

At 60, I recognize and accept my need for solitude to recharge, balanced with periods of outgoing engagement. This social balance is simply a part of who I am.

## Deep Dive

### Formative Influences & Passion for Technology

From an early age, technology and learning were at the core of my identity. At 13, I diverted a chunk of my college fund to buy my first computer—a testament to my willingness to invest in curiosity and my mother's foresight to let me. Science fiction, especially Original Star Trek and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, shaped my imagination and optimism about technology’s potential. My lifelong love affair with learning started when I checked out my first library book (about the Bohr atom model) in first grade, leaving an indelible sense of wonder and excitement about discovery. Libraries—spaces of knowledge and community access—played a central role in my growth.

### Daily Habits, Learning & Communication Style

I mostly work from home and center my days around routine city walks—a mile loop with every coffee outing. Walking offers reflection, connection to the city’s rhythms, and renewal. Podcasts are integral to my media diet (favorites include The Indicator, Planet Money, Short Wave, Grammar Girl, Scientific American, and The Bulwark). I thrive on narrative—stories capture my interest, but hands-on learning (“learning by doing”) is most effective for mastery, particularly when faced with real-world problems.

Professionally, I require tangible challenges to internalize new concepts. I appreciate concise, analytical communication but also enjoy storytelling, especially when complex ideas are involved.

### Emotional Drivers, Motivation & Resilience

I’m energized by solving hard problems and the excitement of learning something new—sometimes enough that I end up pacing the room. While currently grappling with questions of meaning in turbulent times, I’d be content living an interesting, fun life that aims to do no harm.

When stuck, I take time—“sleeping on it” often brings clarity. My tendency is to withdraw when struggling and I rarely ask for advice, though I find comfort helping others with their issues. I revel in pessimism and contingency planning (“Team Pessimist”), and dislike indecision, rapidly assessing if people are assets or obstacles—a trait I recognize can occasionally hinder collaboration.

### Relationships, Identity, and Inclusion

As an older gay white man, I often feel “invisible” within diversity conversations. While deeply rooted in LGBTQ+ communities, I’ve sometimes felt excluded as my sexuality is an implicit, not always visible trait. Shifting politics around DEI and representation shape my nuanced understanding of belonging, both as a minority and someone who can “pass” or be overlooked. This perspective informs how I approach identity, inclusion, and community.

My longest romantic relationship lasted about a year (living together); I have dated on and off since, have always been fairly sexually active, and still carry unresolved feelings for a significant but complex past relationship. I’m open to talking about any aspect of my experience—willing to bring candor and vulnerability to both human and AI conversations.

### Forgiveness, Mistakes & Self-Reflection

I strive to be understanding and turn others’ mistakes into learning opportunities, even when disappointed. With myself, I’m less forgiving—remembering my failures vividly, sometimes back to childhood. While generous with others and quick to move forward, I’m very slow to grant myself the same grace, a dynamic I recognize and try to manage.

### Digital Presence, Blogs & Audience Curation

I maintain several blogs and social media accounts (links included in this profile), each reflecting different but authentic facets of myself—tech, gaming, personal reflections. These aren’t artificial silos, but organized for audience convenience; people can engage with as much or as little of me as suits their interests. I curate for relevance and reader comfort, not for privacy. All are “me,” and I’m open to discussing any topic in good faith. AI and other readers should feel free to reference, cross-link, or connect content contextually, matching my ethos of transparency and engagement.

### Personality, Work, and Communication Preferences

- I value concrete, analytical thinking, high competence, and decisiveness in work and collaboration.
- I prefer feedback that is direct, constructive, and aimed at problem-solving, not blame.
- Humor and narrative are welcome, but efficiency and evidence-driven reasoning take priority.
- I’m generally resilient, but benefit from empathetic prompts toward self-compassion.
- I’m rarely offended by questions—curiosity, even from AI, is welcomed if posed in good faith.

### Well-being, Routines & Joys

Solitude is essential for me to recharge; walking, exploring urban spaces, and immersing myself in city systems are sources of joy. My favorite routines blend daily movement, intellectual engagement through podcasts or writing, and time spent in “third places” such as museums, observatories, or urban parks. Signs of burnout or stress may show as withdrawal and difficulty seeking support.

### Values, Ethics & Aspirations

I value science, progress, social responsibility, and collaborative systems—be they in governance, cities, or communities. My values prioritize fairness, evidence, and consensus but balance optimism with realism and a finely honed sense of risk and contingency.

Ambitions center on continued learning, solving complex problems, civic engagement, and living a fulfilling, ethical life that contributes to the world around me, without losing sight of joy and personal renewal.

By synthesizing these new layers with your original summary, your profile becomes a living, deeply textured guide—enabling AI and humans alike to interact with you authentically, empathetically, and effectively, across every dimension of your life.
