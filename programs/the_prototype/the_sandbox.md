# The Sandbox

The Sandbox is a creative and immersive space designed for exploration, training, and scenario-based planning. It serves as a platform for the crew to engage in simulations, develop strategies, and enhance their skills in a controlled environment. The Holodeck team is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the simulations and ensuring that all programs run smoothly.
