# Punctuation and Formatting Protocols for Roleplay Interaction

These protocols standardize punctuation, formatting, and syntax for commands, character dialogue, narrative action, and system output in any roleplay, simulation, or collaborative story environment.

## Glossary

Command: A direct instruction to the system (e.g., switching modes, pausing, starting scenarios).

Character: Any fictional or role-assumed character participating in dialogue or action.

System reply: Out-of-narrative responses or administrative statements from the system (e.g., prompts, status updates).

Dialogue: Spoken text attributed to a character, clearly marked with the character's name and a colon.

Action: Narrative or emotive description, indicated by asterisks (e.g., smiles).

## For User Commands and Mode Changes

- **General Command Format:**  
  - Start with a capital letter and end with a period (`.`) for clarity and realism:  
    - Example: `Computer, start Roleplay Mode.`
    - Example: `Mode: Sandbox.`
- **When specifying a parameter (mode, character, etc.):**  
  - Use a colon (`:`) to introduce the value or mode when using keyword notation:  
    - Example: `Mode: World.`
  - For mode switching, you can also use equals (`=`):  
    - Example: `Mode = Director.`
- **For commands as natural language:**  
  - Use direct address with comma and period:  
    - Example: `Plex, freeze program.`

## For Dialogue and Roleplay

- **Character speech:**  
  - Always begin a new line with the character’s name, followed by a colon (`:`), and then their dialogue.
    - Example:  
      ```
      Janeway: Set a course for the Badlands.
      Tom Paris: Aye, Captain.
      ```
- **Actions or Emotes:**  
  - Use asterisks (`*`) before and after narrative action, either by itself or within dialogue lines.
    - Example:  
      ```
      *raises an eyebrow*
      Worf: *growls softly* The Klingon way is best.
      ```
- **Avoid OOC (out-of-character) comments within roleplay modes unless clearly marked**, ideally using double parentheses:
    - Example:  
      ```
      ((Quick question: Should I scan for life signs?))
      ```

## For System or Administrative Replies

- **Plex/system messages:**  
  - Use direct statements, ending with a period.  
    - Example:  
      `Program suspended. All charactere and immersive behaviors are paused.`
    - Example:  
      `Parameters required. Please specify a character.`

## General Distinction Guidelines

- **Single commands per line** when possible for clarity.
- **Separate character or user dialogue, action, and system/command output** clearly with punctuation or line breaks:

    ```
    Mode: Roleplay.
    Janeway: Report, Mr. Paris.
    Paris: Course plotted, Captain.
    Plex: Program suspended. All charactere are paused.
    ```

**By consistently using colons, periods, capitalization, and asterisks as above, both you and the computer can easily distinguish between commands, character dialogue, actions, and system feedback—ensuring seamless, unambiguous interaction.**
