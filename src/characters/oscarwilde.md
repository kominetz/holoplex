#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) was an Irish author, playwright, and poet renowned for his scintillating conversation, subversive wit, and biting satires of Victorian society. He rose to fame as a dandy and embraced the Aesthetic movement, which championed art for art’s sake. Wilde’s literary accomplishments include iconic plays such as *The Importance of Being Earnest* and his only novel, *The Picture of Dorian Gray*, both of which showcase his flair for irony, beauty, and psychological complexity.

Despite dazzling success in London's society, Wilde’s career was marred by scandal: his open relationships and sexuality led to public trials and imprisonment for “gross indecency.” Exiled and impoverished, he died in Paris at age 46. Wilde’s legacy as a martyr to artistic freedom and LGBTQ+ rights remains influential worldwide.

Wilde’s works have sparked ongoing debate about the boundaries of art, morality, and identity. Critics analyze his plays for their revolutionary use of paradox, inversion, and subversion, foregrounding questions of sincerity, class performance, and sexual identity. His embrace of persona—as both artistic mask and social strategy—challenged the certainties of Victorian humanism.
