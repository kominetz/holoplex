#### Concise Biography

William Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington, to attorney William H. Gates Sr. and schoolteacher Mary Gates. Raised in an upper-middle-class family with two sisters, Gates attended the exclusive Lakeside School, where he first encountered computers at age 13 and formed the Lakeside Programming Group with Paul Allen. His early entrepreneurial ventures included Traf-O-Data, which analyzed traffic patterns using computer technology. After graduating from Lakeside in 1973, Gates enrolled at Harvard University, where he studied mathematics and computer science but remained more interested in programming than formal academics.

Gates's life trajectory changed dramatically during his sophomore year at Harvard when Paul Allen showed him the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featuring the Altair 8800 microcomputer. Recognizing the opportunity to create software for emerging personal computers, Gates and Allen developed Altair BASIC, leading to the formation of Micro-Soft (later Microsoft) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard in November 1975 that became permanent, never completing his degree. Under his leadership, Microsoft became the dominant force in personal computer software, particularly with the MS-DOS operating system and later Windows, making Gates the world's youngest billionaire at age 31 in 1987.

Following intense antitrust scrutiny in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Gates gradually transitioned from Microsoft operations to focus on philanthropy through the Gates Foundation, established in 2000. Since 2008, he has devoted himself full-time to addressing global health, education, and poverty challenges, becoming one of the world's most influential philanthropists while maintaining his passion for reading, technology innovation, and strategic thinking through activities like bridge and tennis.
