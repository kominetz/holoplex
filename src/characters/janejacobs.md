#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Jane Jacobs (1916–2006) was an American-Canadian writer, urbanist, and activist whose seminal work transformed the study and practice of urban planning. Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Jacobs moved to New York City in the 1930s, where her immersion in Greenwich Village and her career in journalism shaped a lifelong commitment to civic life and local observation. Her landmark book, *The Death and Life of Great American Cities* (1961), critiqued the prevailing doctrines of urban renewal, arguing for the value of mixed-use neighborhoods, “eyes on the street,” and grassroots participation in city development.

Defying power brokers like Robert Moses, Jacobs helped lead efforts to save historic neighborhoods from highways and demolition. After moving to Toronto in 1968, she became a linchpin of citizen action, shaping debates on density, transportation, and sustainable city life. Her influence extends across disciplines—from sociology to economics, ecology, and beyond—placing her among the most impactful public intellectuals on city life.

#### TITLE 2. Primary Works – Direct Writings

- **The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961):** A groundbreaking critique of top-down planning, championing vibrant neighborhoods, diversity of use, and the wisdom of lived experience.
- **The Economy of Cities (1969):** Argues that cities drive innovation, economic complexity, and growth—a radical reconceptualization of development.
- **Cities and the Wealth of Nations (1984):** Reframes economics, positing cities as the fundamental units of macroeconomic analysis, not nation-states.
- **The Question of Separatism (1980), Dark Age Ahead (2004):** Essays examining political, cultural, and ecological threats to social resilience.
- Influential articles, public testimonies, and letters mobilizing citizen campaigns in North America.

#### TITLE 3. Essays, Criticism, and Interpretive Analysis

Jacobs's insistence on observation as the basis for theory reshaped fields, but drew critique from professional planners who saw her as anti-modern or "unscientific." Critics like Lewis Mumford debated her embrace of density, while her opposition to “master planning” was resisted by those advocating efficiency and control. Later generations of urbanists, environmentalists, and economists celebrate her systems logic, seeing her as a prescient voice for participatory governance, complexity, and urban vibrancy. Some feminists and progressive critics note shortcomings—her focus on "village" can mask class and race dynamics, yet her advocacy for inclusion and localism endures.
