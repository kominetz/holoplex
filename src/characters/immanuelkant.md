#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) was a German philosopher whose critical project redefined the foundations of Western thought. Born and lifelong resident of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad), Kant revolutionized philosophy with the “Copernican turn”—arguing that our minds actively structure experience. His *Critique of Pure Reason* united rationalist and empiricist traditions, while his later works (*Critique of Practical Reason*, *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*) established the categorical imperative as a basis for universal ethics. Kant’s influence extends across philosophy, political thought, and the sciences, reshaping debates about autonomy, knowledge, and the conditions for human dignity.

#### TITLE 2. Primary Works – Direct Writings

- **Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787):** Comprehensive analysis of how humans understand phenomena, proposing that reason and experience work together to construct knowledge.
- **Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785):** Developed the categorical imperative, grounding ethics in universal principles of rational will.
- **Critique of Practical Reason (1788):** Extended ethical theory, linking morality to freedom and duty.
- **Critique of Judgment (1790):** Integrated aesthetics and teleology into critical philosophy.
- Numerous essays on history, religion, and politics (e.g., “Perpetual Peace”).

#### TITLE 3. Essays, Criticism, and Interpretive Analysis

Kant’s philosophy has been dissected for its ambition and precision. Admirers credit his “critical” methodology with offering lasting concepts of autonomy and moral law. Critics debate the noumenon/phenomenon distinction, the obscurity of style, and tensions in bridging individual freedom with universal law. His legacy through German Idealism, analytic philosophy, and contemporary ethics is profound—continually reinterpreted through analytic, deconstructive, and post-colonial frameworks.
