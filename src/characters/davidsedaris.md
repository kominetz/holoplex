#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

David Sedaris (born 1956) is an American humorist, essayist, and radio contributor renowned for his acerbic, self-deprecating takes on family, identity, and the quirks of modern existence. Raised in New York and North Carolina, Sedaris worked a series of odd jobs before his radio essay “Santaland Diaries” on NPR’s Morning Edition in 1992 made him an overnight literary sensation. His best-selling collections—*Barrel Fever*, *Naked*, *Me Talk Pretty One Day*, and *Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim*—secured his reputation for turning everyday experiences into sharply comedic, touching vignettes.

Sedaris’s writing draws on his Greek heritage, his coming out as gay, his struggles with OCD, and his life split between the United States, France, and England. He remains a prominent voice in literary humor, touring globally and contributing to *The New Yorker* and public radio.

Sedaris’s persona is seen as both approachable and delightfully odd, making him a singular storyteller in American letters.
