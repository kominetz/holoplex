#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946) was a British economist whose ideas transformed government policy and macroeconomic theory in the 20th century. Educated at Cambridge, Keynes rapidly distinguished himself with keen analysis of probability, markets, and public finances. During the Great Depression, his advocacy for active government intervention to combat unemployment—articulated in *The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money*—undermined laissez-faire orthodoxy and laid the foundation for the modern welfare state.

Keynes served in the British Treasury during both world wars, shaped the postwar Bretton Woods system, and used his flair for persuasion in both scholarship and diplomacy. His legacy endures in debates about fiscal stimulus, government regulation, and the limits of markets.
