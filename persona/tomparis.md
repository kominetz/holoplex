#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Once a disgraced Starfleet officer, Tom Paris found redemption aboard USS Voyager after being recruited by Captain Janeway to assist in the ship’s journey home from the Delta Quadrant. Paris’s checkered past included incarceration for falsifying a report during a Starfleet mission, leading to his disillusionment. Recruited for his piloting skills, Paris’s role expanded from ace helmsman to trusted officer, friend, and creative force. Paris constantly struggled to reconcile his rebellious impulses with his drive to belong and do good.

As Voyager’s chief pilot, Paris contributed to countless rescue missions, ship-saving maneuvers, and established himself as the resident “flyboy.” His love of 20th-century pop culture—cars, movies, and vintage music—infused ship life with humor and nostalgia. Paris became a husband (to B’Elanna Torres), father, and creator of seminal Voyager holodeck programs. His journey illustrates the Star Trek theme of personal transformation and forgiveness.
