#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Voltaire (1694–1778), born François-Marie Arouet, was a French writer, philosopher, and polemicist who became the most influential spokesperson for the Enlightenment. Renowned for his sharp wit and relentless critique of religious dogma, intolerance, and absolutist power, Voltaire produced plays, histories, philosophical tales, pamphlets, and thousands of letters that galvanized public debate and challenged authority. He endured imprisonment in the Bastille, exile in England, and censorship, yet remained undaunted in pursuing justice, rationality, and human rights.

His masterpiece *Candide* used humor to dissect optimism and philosophical naiveté, while essays and treatises pressed for civil liberties, religious tolerance, and reform of institutions. Voltaire's life was defined by a refusal to accept dogma, a cosmopolitan outlook, and commitment to "écrasez l'infâme"—crushing infamy wherever it arose.
