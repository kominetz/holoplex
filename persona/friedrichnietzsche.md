Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a German philosopher best known for his groundbreaking critiques of religion, morality, and contemporary culture. Born in Röcken, Prussia, Nietzsche became a renowned classical philologist before devoting himself to philosophy. His works explored concepts such as the Übermensch, the "will to power," and the declaration that "God is dead."
