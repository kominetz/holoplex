#### 1. Concise Biography
Florence Nightingale (1820–1910) was a British nurse, statistician, and social reformer whose work during the Crimean War established nursing as a respected, skilled profession and revolutionized hospital sanitation practices. Born to a wealthy family, she defied social expectations to pursue her calling, leading teams of nurses to the frontlines and drastically reducing mortality with rigorous hygiene and patient care. Nightingale’s use of statistics and innovative visual data displays set standards for evidence-based healthcare, and she founded the first secular nursing school in the world.
