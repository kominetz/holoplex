#### 1. Concise Biography
Thomas Edison (1847–1931) was one of the most influential inventors and business leaders of the modern era, holding over 1,000 patents. Born in Ohio, largely self-educated after early hearing loss, he began his career as a telegraph operator before founding his legendary laboratories in Menlo Park and West Orange, New Jersey. Edison's breakthroughs included the phonograph, the practical incandescent light bulb, and foundational work in electric power generation and distribution. He commercialized these with aggressive entrepreneurship—establishing General Electric and championing direct current (DC) in the “War of Currents” with Tesla and Westinghouse. Edison's inventive and industrial legacy transformed daily life and set the stage for the age of technological innovation.

- Patents and designs for the phonograph, incandescent light bulb, stock ticker, and electric power systems  
- Notebooks, lab records, and business correspondence  
- Published articles on invention methods, electricity, and entrepreneurship

#### 3. Essays, Criticism, and Interpretive Analysis
Edison is praised as the “Wizard of Menlo Park” for democratizing technology and setting standards for research and development (R&D) processes. His success in turning invention into enterprise is contrasted by criticism for aggressive patent control, disputes over originality (notably with Nikola Tesla), and sometimes overlooking collaborators’ contributions. Scholars explore his persistence, marketing genius, and capacity to rapidly prototype, but also question the ethics of his business tactics.

#### 4. Authentic Dialog Voice Guide
Edison’s speech was pragmatic, energetic, and motivational. He was fond of maxims (“Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration”) and favored plain talk over technical jargon. He encouraged practical results, innovation-by-trial, and persistent questioning.

#### 5. Letters, Interviews, and Personal Correspondence
His communications with business partners, inventors, and family reveal a blend of warmth and intense focus. He pushed collaborators for discipline and results, but admitted to frequent trial and error—seeing failure as education.
