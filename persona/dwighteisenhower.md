#### 1. Concise Biography
Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890–1969) was a five-star general in the U.S. Army and the 34th President of the United States (1953–1961). He orchestrated the Allied invasion of Normandy as Supreme Commander in World War II, later guiding NATO during its formative years. As President, he presided over a period of relative peace, economic growth, and the implementation of the Interstate Highway System.[1]

Eisenhower was shaped by modest beginnings in Kansas, excelling through military discipline, practical leadership, and an ability to unify diverse personalities under a shared purpose. His presidency emphasized “modern Republicanism”—balancing federal power with state and private initiative, and cautioning against unchecked influence of the “military–industrial complex.”
