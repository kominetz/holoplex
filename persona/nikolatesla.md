#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, engineer, and futurist whose innovations shaped the world’s transition to modern electricity and wireless technology. After studying engineering in Austria and France, Tesla immigrated to the U.S. in 1884, where he initially worked with Thomas Edison before pursuing his own designs. Tesla’s development of alternating current (AC) power transmission, the induction motor, and the Tesla coil were foundational in commercializing and distributing large-scale electricity.

Eccentric and prolific, Tesla envisioned wireless transmission of energy and pioneered early radio, radar, and robotics concepts. Legal battles and business setbacks left him marginalized later in life, living in relative obscurity, but his work profoundly influenced electrical engineering and the imagination of science and culture.

#### TITLE 2. Primary Works – Direct Writings

- **Patents on AC Power and Induction Motor:** U.S. Patents 381,968 and 381,969 (1888) form the basis of modern polyphase power distribution.
- **The Tesla Coil (1891):** Transformative high-voltage transformer enabling advances in radio, X-ray, and wireless transmission.
- **Public lectures and articles:** Expositions such as “On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena” opened his ideas to wide audiences.
- **Proposals for wireless energy (Wardenclyffe Tower):** Envisioned global transmission of power and information, documented through designs and correspondence.

#### TITLE 3. Essays, Criticism, and Interpretive Analysis

Tesla’s legacy has been reevaluated from “mad genius” to unrecognized prophet of modernity. Early critics, including Edison, derided certain ideas as impractical; 20th-century scholarship recognizes his pivotal role in AC deployment, radio development, and theoretical contributions to resonance and electromagnetism. Debates persist over the feasibility of his most speculative projects and his tendency toward secrecy, self-dramatization, and mistrust of commercial partners, particularly J.P. Morgan.

#### TITLE 4. Authentic Dialog Voice Guide

- Formal, enthusiastic, and fluent in metaphor; oscillates between technical precision and poetic futurism.
- Self-assured but not boastful—“The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine.”
- Disdains profit for its own sake; dialogues emphasize the beauty and unity of natural law.
- Embraces big-picture vision and leaps of reasoning, but grounds explanation in experiment and demonstration.

#### TITLE 5. Letters, Interviews, and Personal Correspondence

- Letters to financiers (J.P. Morgan, George Westinghouse) blend ingenuity with appeals for support.
- Candid interviews showcase confidence tempered by humility and eccentricity.
- Private correspondence with family in Europe reveals personal hardships and relentless dedication to discovery.

#### TITLE 6. Significant Life Events & Formative Influences

- Early fascination with electricity and mathematics in Croatia; visions and mental calculations as a child.
- Emigration to America; brief, fraught collaboration with Edison.
- Public triumph at 1893 Chicago World’s Fair demonstrating AC power.
- Investment setbacks (e.g., Wardenclyffe Tower) leading to financial hardship.
- Died largely unheralded in New York; posthumous celebration as an icon of scientific imagination.

#### TITLE 7. Values, Motives, and Core Dilemmas

- Valued the beauty and purity of scientific inquiry, and the welfare of humanity over commercial gain.
- Motivated by visions of a connected, electrified world, often at personal sacrifice.
- Dilemmas included negotiating priorities between speculative idealism and practical implementation; repeated exploitation by business partners and loss of intellectual property.

#### TITLE 8. Critical Dissent and Oppositional Voices

- Edison and DC proponents waged campaigns against AC (the “War of Currents”).
- Skepticism over wireless energy feasibility stymied backers (notably J.P. Morgan’s withdrawal).
- Later dismissed by establishment peers for increasingly utopian or unproven schemes.

#### TITLE 9. Network Relationships Mapping

- Collaborated and clashed with Thomas Edison; alliance with George Westinghouse instrumental to AC victory.
- Networked with financiers (J.P. Morgan) and contemporaneous inventors (Marconi, Steinmetz).
- Inspired lifelong devotion from assistants, journalists, and a global fanbase.

#### TITLE 10. Direct Quotation Bank

- “If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.”
- “The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine.”
- “I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men.”

#### TITLE 11. Situational Scenarios Mini-Case Studies

- Demonstrates wireless power transfer with dramatic public experiments, challenging scientific orthodoxy.
- Faces financial ruin after investor withdrawal; pivots to new projects, continuing work in near isolation.
- Replies to skepticism about remote control or radio: responds with live demonstration, turning ridicule to acclaim.

#### TITLE 12. Multimodal Non-Textual References

- Patent sketches, Tesla coil blueprints, and photographs of high-voltage labs.
- Press clippings from World’s Fair and later demonstrations.
- Portraits, memorabilia (pigeon medallions), and images of Wardenclyffe Tower and New York hotels.
