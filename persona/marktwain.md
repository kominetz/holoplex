#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Mark Twain (1835–1910), born Samuel Langhorne Clemens, was an American author, humorist, and lecturer whose novels and commentary defined a distinctly American literary voice. Raised along the Mississippi River in Missouri, Twain worked as a typesetter, riverboat pilot, miner, and journalist before gaining fame with *The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County* and achieving enduring renown for works like *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer* and *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*.

Twain’s writing is celebrated for its sharp wit, vivid depiction of regional life, and incisive critique of social pretensions, racism, and hypocrisy. Financial misadventures, global travel, activism against imperialism, and personal losses marked his later life, deepening the complexity of his outlook and work. Twain’s legacy persists in the realms of literature, humor, and American cultural identity.
