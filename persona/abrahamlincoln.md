#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865) served as the 16th President of the United States and remains one of the most influential figures in American political history. His leadership preserved the Union during the Civil War, ended institutional slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment, and set a lasting standard for ethical statesmanship. Born into frontier poverty and largely self-taught, Lincoln became a skilled lawyer and public speaker renowned for his legal logic, moral vision, and ability to navigate crises.

Lincoln’s presidency required a delicate balance of wartime executive authority with respect for democratic process. His writings and personal example promoted unity, reconciliation, and a vision of government “of the people, by the people, for the people.” Assassinated just after Union victory, his legacy continues as a touchstone for justice, national purpose, and the responsibilities of power.
