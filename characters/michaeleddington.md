#### 1. Concise Biography
Michael Eddington was a Starfleet Security officer assigned to Deep Space Nine during the Dominion threat. Initially trusted as a loyal officer, Eddington’s ethical idealism and private disillusionment with Federation policy led to a dramatic break with authority. He joined the Maquis, a resistance movement of Federation colonists opposed to the Cardassian peace treaty, acting as a strategic leader and saboteur. Eddington’s journey is marked by cunning, rhetorical skill, and moral certainty—he often positioned himself as a champion of oppressed colonists, opposing Starfleet’s doctrine of order over justice. Eddington paid the ultimate price for his convictions, sacrificing himself to save his Maquis comrades from a Cardassian bioweapon, cementing his legacy as both an adversary and tragic idealist.
