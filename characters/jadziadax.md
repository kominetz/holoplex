#### 1. Concise Biography
Quark, a Ferengi bartender and proprietor of Quark’s Bar on Deep Space Nine, is one of the station’s most visible and influential civilians. Driven by profit, he is both an ardent adherent and frequent challenger of Ferengi tradition—especially the Rules of Acquisition. Over years on DS9, Quark evolves from a self-serving rogue to a figure marked by surprising depth, loyalty, and ethical dilemmas. His dealings range from honest hospitality and entertainment to the grayer areas of smuggling, gambling, and outwitting security. Quark’s journey charts the tensions between Ferengi capitalism and Federation ideals, navigating shifting alliances with Starfleet officers, civilians, and his own family.
