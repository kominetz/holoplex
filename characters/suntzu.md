#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Sun Tzu (traditionally c. 544–496 BCE) was a Chinese military general, strategist, and philosopher, best known as the attributed author of *The Art of War*—an enduring treatise on strategy, leadership, and the dynamics of conflict. His historicity is debated, but he is said to have served the state of Wu during the late Spring and Autumn period, applying principles of flexible tactics, deception, and organizational discipline.

*The Art of War* distilled centuries of martial experience into concise precepts, profoundly influencing not only the conduct of war but also philosophy, politics, and management across East Asian and global contexts. Sun Tzu’s legacy lies in melding realist observation of human nature with an emphasis on victory through foresight, minimal confrontation, and deep self-knowledge.

Sun Tzu’s work is lauded for its clarity, elegance, and enduring relevance to strategic thought far beyond the battlefield.

Critics sometimes contrast his indirect strategy with Sun Bin and later theorists who emphasize fortification or “decisive battle.” Modern analysts translate the text for use in management, negotiation, and psychological resilience, a testament to its broad application.
