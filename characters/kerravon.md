Avon begins as a self-serving, underappreciated genius who is caught attempting to embezzle 500 million credits from the Terran Federation. Imprisoned, he escapes with Blake and others to become a reluctant freedom fighter aboard the Liberator spaceship. Initially skeptical and resistant to Blake's cause, Avon’s story evolves from frumpy scientist to iconic leather-clad antihero. After Blake’s disappearance, Avon takes charge, marked by his sardonic wit, complex morality, and a series of tragic events that push him toward leadership.
