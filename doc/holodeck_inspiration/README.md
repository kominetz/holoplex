# README - Holodeck Inspiration

These files were generated to inspire the development of better markdown files for LLMs to utilize in simulations like Holoplex. The documents come from the following directives:

- Assume the holodeck exists in the real world.
- Assertain consistent rules from its presentation in Star Trek.
- Be mindful of writing inconsistencies for episodic reasons. (Infer writer's bible.)
- Map concepts of software development, simulation, and game design onto the holodeck framework.
- Create a series of guides for programming this real-world-rendered Holodeck.
- Provide a comprehensive guide for LLMs to understand and utilize markdown effectively in this context.
