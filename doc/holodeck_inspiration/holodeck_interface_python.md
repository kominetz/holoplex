# Star Trek Holodeck Python Package Documentation

A conceptual Python package designed to model the Star Trek holodeck programming interface. This documentation mirrors canonical usage observed in TNG, DS9, and Voyager, translating frequent holodeck terms and user interactions into Python classes, methods, and idioms.

***

## Package Overview

```python
"""
starfleet.holodeck
==================

A Python package representing the Star Trek holodeck programming environment.
Provides interfaces and classes for program management, character creation,
safety protocol control, and simulation interaction.

Main Modules:
- holodeck: The core control interface.
- character: Holographic character modeling.
- program: Program creation and lifecycle management.
- emh: Emergency Medical Hologram specialization.
- enums: Program and safety status enums.

## Enums and Utility Types

```python
from enum import Enum

class ProgramStatus(Enum):
    RUNNING = 1
    TERMINATED = 2
    FROZEN = 3
    SUSPENDED = 4
    LOADING = 5
    ERROR = 6

class SafetyStatus(Enum):
    ENABLED = 1
    DISABLED = 2
    PARTIAL = 3
    MALFUNCTION = 4

class AwarenessLevel(Enum):
    NONE = 1
    LIMITED = 2
    PARTIAL = 3
    FULL_AWARENESS = 4
    TRANSCENDENT = 5

class SentienceLevel(Enum):
    NON_SENTIENT = 1
    RESPONSIVE = 2
    ADAPTIVE = 3
    SENTIENT = 4
    AUTONOMOUS = 5

class ProgramType(Enum):
    HOLONOVEL = 1
    TRAINING = 2
    RECREATIONAL = 3
    DIAGNOSTIC = 4
    HISTORICAL_RECREATION = 5
    SIMULATION = 6
```

## Design Patterns Employed

- **Command Pattern:** Python methods directly correspond to canonical voice commands.
- **Factory Pattern:** Methods for program and character creation abstract complex initialization.
- **State Tracking:** Enum objects for program, safety, and character states.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Differing behaviors via program types and character personalities.
- **Observer and Composite:** Characters evolve or aggregate within programs.

***

## Usage Example

```python
from starfleet.holodeck import Holodeck, ProgramType, CharacterParameters, ProgramParameters

holodeck = Holodeck()
holodeck.run_program('DixonHillMystery')
holodeck.create_character('Moriarty', CharacterParameters(intelligence='genius', motivation='adversary'))
holodeck.freeze_program()
holodeck.arch().display()
holodeck.enable_safety_protocols()
```
