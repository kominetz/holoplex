**World Mode**—defined as a persistent, autonomous simulated environment where multiple personae and environments run continuously and can interact with a user as participant, observer, or director—is *partially possible* in Perplexity, but not yet as a fully native, persistent, open-ended simulation like you’d see in some advanced standalone platforms or research AI labs.

### What Perplexity Currently Offers

- **Perplexity Labs:**  
  Perplexity Labs can build interactive branching simulations and project environments directly from user prompts. These simulations can feature autonomous agents, branching scenarios, and complex data or environmental logic. From a prompt, Labs can generate code, assets, persistent settings, and even launch playable simulation projects.[1][2]
  - *Example:* Labs has produced interactive “AI in the Real World” simulations where user actions trigger immediate, persistent world changes and autonomous scoring, feedback, and state management—the system tracks agents, decisions, and logic through multiple rounds.

- **Supported Modes & Conversation Context:**  
  Perplexity’s conversational engine maintains detailed context, supporting deep follow-up questions, elaborate scenario progression, and persistent threads across sessions. You can “simulate worlds” in text—e.g., create an ongoing fictional universe, maintain cast lists, and run through scenarios—but *true* world persistence and autonomy depends on the scope of your prompt and manual session management.[3][4]

- **Focus Modes & Structured Research:**  
  While Perplexity provides focus modes for Academic, Social, Video, and more—these are tailored to different sources, not to autonomous simulated worlds.[4][3]

### Limitations for Full World Mode

- Perplexity does **not** currently offer a true “open world simulation” as a first-class mode—where an AI engine autonomously handles multiple agents, persistent world state, ongoing events, and real-time environmental development in the background.
- Persistent “World Mode” functionalities like those seen in Google’s Genie 3 or custom game engines (complex environmental autonomy, interactive physics, visual rendering, real-time world state evolution) are not yet available inside Perplexity.[5]
- You *can* build project-based simulations that *approximate* world logic using Labs, but they require explicit user prompts, manual session management, and do not persist or evolve outside of the current project context.[2][1]

### How to Achieve World-Like Experiences in Perplexity

- Use Perplexity Labs to:
    - Generate interactive project environments by describing the world, its logic, and desired agents in a prompt.
    - Build simulation code and assets; Perplexity can package and launch these as standalone web apps, dashboards, or branching scenarios.[1][2]
- Use persistent conversation history and context for ongoing fictional worlds in text (e.g., roleplay threads, story arcs).
- For real open world simulation (autonomous, persistent, evolving), you would currently need an external world-model engine, custom AI agent infrastructure, or platforms like Genie 3.[5]

### Summary

- **World Mode as described in your protocol is possible to simulate in Perplexity with some limitations,** mostly through Perplexity Labs and creative use of prompts/projects.
- It does **not** natively support fully autonomous, persistent, open-world simulation as a built-in mode as of August 2025.
- True world modeling (autonomous environments, detailed physics, real-time event progression) is still best achieved with dedicated simulation platforms, though Perplexity is steadily evolving toward these capabilities.
