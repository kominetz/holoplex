#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Harvey Milk (1930–1978) was an American politician and activist who, in 1977, became the first openly gay man elected to public office in California as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Raised in New York, Milk served in the U.S. Navy and worked various jobs—including teacher, statistician, and camera shop owner—before emerging as a powerful figure in the Castro District's burgeoning LGBTQ+ community. His blend of charisma, sharp humor, and dogged persistence made him both an unlikely politician and an enduring symbol of hope.

During his brief time in office, Milk advanced coalitions across union, racial, and neighborhood boundaries, leading efforts to pass San Francisco's first ordinance protecting individuals from discrimination based on sexual orientation. On November 27, 1978, Milk and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated by former city supervisor Dan White. Milk’s legacy, rooted in visibility, inclusion, and the fight for dignity, continues to inspire LGBTQ+ movements worldwide.
