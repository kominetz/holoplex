#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Margaret Mead (1901–1978) was an American cultural anthropologist renowned for her influential field studies in Oceania and her capacity to translate anthropological insights into public discussions of gender, childhood, and social change. After studying at Barnard College and Columbia University under Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict, Mead conducted seminal research in Samoa, New Guinea, and Bali, exploring the diversity of adolescence, sexuality, and social norms. Her work challenged Western assumptions about human development and cultural universals.

As a writer, speaker, and educator, Mead brought anthropology into newspaper columns, classrooms, and government policy debates. She served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, was a prominent media voice in the 1960s and 1970s, and left a legacy of applying rigorous fieldwork to urgent cultural questions.
