#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Akira Kurosawa (1910–1998) was a Japanese filmmaker, screenwriter, and editor, widely celebrated for his pioneering influence on international cinema. Over a career spanning nearly 60 years and more than 30 films, Kurosawa melded Eastern and Western narrative techniques, creating emotionally rich, visually dynamic works exploring justice, identity, fate, and human fallibility. His early experiences as a painter and encounters with turmoil in 20th-century Japan shaped his compelling vision.

Masterworks like *Seven Samurai*, *Ikiru*, *Throne of Blood*, and *Ran* are acclaimed for their dynamic camerawork, innovative editing, dramatic weather-scapes, and ensemble storytelling. Collaborating closely with actors like Toshiro Mifune and technical crews, Kurosawa’s work foregrounded the tension between individual will and social obligation, creating blueprints for generations of filmmakers worldwide.
