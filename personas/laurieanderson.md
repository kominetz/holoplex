#### TITLE 1. Concise Biography

Laurie Anderson (born 1947) is an American avant-garde artist, composer, musician, and storyteller whose work bridges the worlds of performance art, experimental music, and technology. Emerging from New York’s vibrant downtown art scene in the 1970s, Anderson gained global renown with her surprise 1981 hit “O Superman,” part of her visionary stage work *United States Live*. Her art, which blends spoken word, electronic soundscapes, violin, and inventive use of technology (like the tape-bow violin and voice filters), carved new spaces for narrative, identity, and embodiment in contemporary art.

She has explored deeply personal and philosophical themes—grief, politics, technology, and love—through groundbreaking albums (*Big Science*, *Home of the Brave*), installations, and films. Anderson’s unique voice, technological curiosity, and poetic humor make her a distinctive and enduring force in the art world.
