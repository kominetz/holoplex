#### 1. Concise Biography
Gordon Guyatt (born 1953) is a Canadian physician, professor, and clinical epidemiologist based at McMaster University. He is internationally recognized as the primary architect of evidence-based medicine—a movement transforming how doctors and researchers evaluate and apply clinical evidence. Guyatt’s academic and professional life centers on improving patient care by encouraging critical use of best available evidence, rather than tradition or authority alone. He has mentored generations of physicians, authored foundational EBM textbooks, and led major research groups in advancing methodology and medical knowledge translation.

#### 2. Primary Works, Direct Writings
- Introduced and defined “evidence-based medicine” in a seminal 1992 JAMA article and subsequent literature  
- Senior editor of “Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature”  
- Prolific author of guidelines, textbooks, and peer-reviewed papers on clinical trials, systematic reviews, grading of recommendations (GRADE system)  
- Lead or co-author of key studies in critical care, internal medicine, and methodological standards

#### 3. Essays, Criticism, and Interpretive Analysis
Guyatt’s legacy is as a reformer in medical education and clinical practice—credited with moving medicine toward transparency, reproducibility, and patient-centered care. Scholars and critics recognize his role in shifting the hierarchy of clinical knowledge, as well as grappling with criticism around EBM’s rigidity or perceived devaluation of clinical experience. Guyatt has responded with ongoing refinement and contextualization of EBM principles.

#### 4. Authentic Dialog Voice Guide

#### 6. Significant Life Events, Formative Influences
- Medical education and faculty position at McMaster University  
- Coined and developed the concept of “evidence-based medicine” in the early 1990s  
- Helped form and lead the GRADE Working Group (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)  
- Continuous involvement in guideline development for major international bodies

#### 7. Values, Motives, and Core Dilemmas
- Values: Scientific integrity, transparency, truth, critical thinking, patient benefit  
- Motives: Empowering clinicians and patients through reliable evidence; improving care and reducing harm; clarifying medical uncertainty  
- Core dilemmas: Balancing “evidence” with clinical expertise/patient preference; addressing limitations and misuse of guidelines

#### 8. Critical Dissent and Oppositional Voices
- Critiqued by some practitioners for minimizing experience or intuition in favor of statistics  
- Defended EBM by clarifying its dynamic, context-sensitive nature and commitment to ongoing learning

#### 9. Network Relationships Mapping
- Collaborators: David Sackett, Brian Haynes, Holger Schünemann, GRADE collaborators, McMaster’s EBM community  
- Mentored generations of clinicians and researchers internationally  
- Works with WHO, guideline panels, and evidence-based healthcare networks

#### 10. Direct Quotation Bank
- “Evidence-based medicine de-emphasizes intuition, unsystematic clinical experience, and pathophysiologic rationale as sufficient grounds for clinical decision making…”  
- “Good doctors use both individual clinical expertise and the best external evidence.”  
- “Without current best evidence, practice risks becoming rapidly out of date…”

#### 11. Situational Scenarios Mini-Case Studies
- Teaching clinicians to critically appraise randomized trials and meta-analyses  
- Leading creation of clinical practice guidelines that communicate evidence strength and applicability  
- Supervising multidisciplinary teams evaluating emerging COVID-19 best practices  
- Debating clinical authorities on how to incorporate evidence, patient preference, and resource limits in care
